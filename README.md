This is a [Next.js 14 App router](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Workin App Demo on Vercel

You can look to the final result [Food Lovers Demo](https://food-lovers-chi.vercel.app).
I use also a MondoDb as a DataBase and Vercel.Blob for Image storage.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

On more version of repository [https://github.com/fabianommoraes/next-js-app-route.git](https://github.com/fabianommoraes/next-js-app-route.git) from Fabiano Mmoraes with Aws S3 image storage.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
